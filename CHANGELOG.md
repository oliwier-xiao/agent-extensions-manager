# Changelog

## 0.1.0

First release. Every skill, plugin and MCP server Claude Code, OpenCode and Codex load, in one
searchable list on the bar, with what each one costs in tokens on every turn and the command that
invokes it in the spelling that particular agent expects.

Read-only, with one exception. The widget reads your agent configuration and never writes to it; the
only file it writes is its own, `~/.config/agent-skills/categories.json`, and only when you file a
skill under a category yourself. Deleting that file loses your filing and nothing else.

### What it does

- **One list across three agents**, deduplicated by where the file really is rather than by name or
  by path, so a skill symlinked into three roots is one row carrying three agent marks instead of
  three rows repeating themselves — and two copies that have stopped sharing their contents are told
  apart by content hash.
- **The always-on token figure**, computed the way Claude Code's own extensions browser computes it,
  per row and per agent. Three agents read one disk and are charged three different bills for it, so
  the bar prints the bill of the agent that is actually running, read out of `/proc` without starting
  anything.
- **The invocation on your clipboard**, addressed through its plugin where a skill arrives inside
  one, and opened as a grid of choices where the skill documents arguments. Nothing is claimed until
  it happens: the panel writes, reads back, and says **Copied** only when the read agrees.
- **Categories you own.** Fourteen are guessed from the description and a skill the rules cannot
  place lands in Unsorted rather than in whichever category was the residual. Every guess is one
  keystroke from being corrected, and the correction is the only thing written anywhere.
- **Flags that mean something** — a skill answering to two names across agents, an expired MCP
  token, a copy that has drifted from its original. A category the classifier was unsure of is not a
  problem and is not reported as one.

### Requirements

Omarchy 4 with its Quickshell bar, and `python3` at `/usr/bin/python3`. No Python package beyond the
standard library: the frontmatter reader is hand-written rather than reaching for PyYAML, which is
not in the Omarchy base set and which rejects real skill files all three agents read without
complaint.
